## Problem Statemen

Solving the lack of Accessible information for tourists with a Virtual Guide App

Our app is designed to solve the common problem tourists face when finding local tour guides to provide detailed historical information about monuments and landmarks. By leveraging GPS technology, the app will act as a personal virtual tour guide, providing real-time information about the user's location, similar to what a real guide would offer.

# Limitation

-   We have only limited data of location.
-   We are unable to integrate with Google Maps data because it changes something to use, and we have no budget for this.
-   The language translation feature is also not working for now because the Google Translate API also charges something, and we have no budget.

## Our USP

-   Assisting foreign tourists in escaping the hustle and bustle
-   Locating a guide amidst the crowd
-   Unlike conventional apps, we don't just provide information in bulk; instead, we aim to deliver an authentic experience.
-   Trip Guide utilizes real-time GPS location tracking to offer details about places that align with your current location.
